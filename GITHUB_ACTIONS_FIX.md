# GitHub Actions Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 **Issue Fixed**
**Error**: `Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/gcp-cloudrun-function-nodejs/gcp-cloudrun-function-nodejs. Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock`

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **Problem**: 
The workflow was configured to use npm caching (`cache: 'npm'`) but the `package-lock.json` file wasn't committed to the repository.

### **Fix**:
1. ✅ Generated `package-lock.json` file locally
2. ✅ Updated workflow to use proper caching with `npm ci`

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### **Workflow Updated**:
```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'           # ← Now works with package-lock.json

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci              # ← Faster, more reliable than npm install
```

### **File Generated**:
- ✅ `package-lock.json` - Ensures consistent dependency versions

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Commit the Lock File**
```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json for reproducible builds"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Re-run GitHub Actions**
- The workflow will now work correctly
- Dependencies will be cached for faster builds
- `npm ci` provides faster, more reliable installations

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Fix**

- **🚀 Faster builds**: npm cache speeds up dependency installation
- **🔒 Reproducible builds**: package-lock.json ensures exact versions
- **⚡ Reliable installs**: `npm ci` is designed for CI/CD environments
- **📦 Consistent deployments**: Same dependencies across all environments

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

When you use `cache: 'npm'` in GitHub Actions, it expects a lock file to determine cache keys. Without `package-lock.json`, the action couldn't set up caching and failed.

**Now your workflow is optimized for CI/CD! 🎉**
